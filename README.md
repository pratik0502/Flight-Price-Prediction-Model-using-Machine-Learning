# Flight-Price-Prediction-Model-using-Machine-Learning
n this project, we have collected a dataset containing information about flights, including airlines, departure time, arrival time, source city, destination city, duration, stops, class, and price. We aim to build a regression model that can predict the flight prices accurately based on these features.
